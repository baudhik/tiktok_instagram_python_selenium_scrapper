To scrape data from TikTok and Instagram using Python and Playwright, you will need to install the necessary packages and then create a script that automates browser actions to extract data.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do that:

Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Install Playwright for Python: You need to install the Playwright library, which provides APIs to control headless browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

You can install it using pip:
pip install playwright
Install Playwright Browsers: After installing the Playwright package, you also need to install the necessary browsers (Chromium by default).

Run this command:
python -m playwright install
Install Other Libraries: If you're planning to work with JSON data, store it, or make requests, you might also need:


pip install requests json

Step 2: Create Python Script for Scraping
Now let's create a script that can scrape data from TikTok and Instagram using Playwright. Below is an example for scraping:
